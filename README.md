## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (React)
Open another terminal and navigate to the `frontend` folder:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🔬 ML Fairness Module (Core Logic)
The core ML logic is located in `backend/main.py`. It uses:
- **Fairlearn:** For calculating metrics like `demographic_parity_difference` and `disparate_impact_ratio`.
- **CorrelationRemover:** A pre-processing technique to remove the correlation between sensitive features and the rest of the dataset.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Backend on Render
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [Render](https://render.com/) and create a new **Web Service**.
3. Connect your repository.
4. Set the Root Directory to `backend`.
5. Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start Command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000`
7. Deploy.

### Frontend on Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new Project.
2. Import the GitHub repository.
3. Set the Root Directory to `frontend`.
4. Add an Environment Variable: `VITE_API_URL` pointing to your Render backend URL (if you change `API_URL` in `App.jsx` to `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`).
5. Click **Deploy**.
